- What is an Array?
Ans. It is a derived data type using which we can store multiple values which are of same type.

- Why do we need?
Ans. To store multiple values of same type

- How do create an array?
Ans.
    1. Initialization + declaration
        int[] arrayName = new int[10];//10 is size. Non-negative
    2. Declaration and followed by Initialization
        int[] array;
        array = new int[10];
    3. Declaration and direct value assignment
        int[] array = {1,2,3,4,5};

[] denotes it is an array type variable.
- we do not specify anything inside left side []
- when we create an array, an object is created.
- Inside that object array size variables will be created and will be initialized with default value

- How array elements are stored internally?
Ans. Array creation is nothing but object creation.
    All the elements will be part of an object.
    Array elements are stored sequentially.

    int[] array = new int[5];
    array ---> obj{0,0,0,0,0}

- Why array index starts from 0?
Ans. - array variable points to the base address where all elements are stored sequentially.
     - first element : baseAddress + dataTypeSize * 0
     - second element: BA + dataTypeSize * 1



students = new Student[5];
int[] array = {1,2,3,4,5};
array ---> object{1,2,3,4,5};
students ---> object{ref,   ref,    ref,    ref, ref}
                       |    |       |       |      |
                 {1,Sachin} null   null     null    null
